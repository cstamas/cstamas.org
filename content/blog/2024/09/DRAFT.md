"Modern History of Maven"

This article would cover Maven "modern history" only. If you are wondering about it, let me jump ahead of it: 
Yep, Maven do have such a thing, as Maven project itself is over 20 years old!

SNIPPETS

Maven 3 is not dead. It will be supported for some time, and still have very nice treats (that existed for roughly
10 years now!) like ["build avoidance and incremental builds"](https://github.com/takari/takari-lifecycle),
["aggressive parallel building"](https://github.com/takari/takari-smart-builder),
["non XML POMs"](https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven/) and the latest ["daemon"](https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd/tree/mvnd-1.x)
are and will remain available for Maven 3.

Also, Maven 4 will most probably ingest these treats
above, and offer the "out of the box".
